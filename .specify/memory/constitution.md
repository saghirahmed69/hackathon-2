## Project Identity

This project is part of **Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo, Phase I**.

The goal of this phase is to build a Python-based in-memory Todo console application using strict Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus, without writing code manually.

**Technology**: Python (in-memory, console-only)
**Methodology**: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
**Tools**: Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
**Phase**: I (Foundation)

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All development MUST start from written specifications, never from code.

- No file may be implemented unless a corresponding spec exists and is approved
- Code is considered invalid if it is not traceable back to a written spec
- If implementation is incorrect, the spec MUST be refined, not the code manually edited

**Rationale**: Ensures requirements drive implementation, prevents scope drift, and maintains alignment with project methodology.

### II. No Manual Coding

The human developer MUST NOT write Python code directly.

- All implementation MUST be generated by Claude Code
- If output is incorrect, the spec MUST be refined and regenerated
- Manual code edits invalidate the development process

**Rationale**: Enforces pure AI-assisted development workflow and demonstrates Spec-Driven Development methodology adherence.

### III. Phase I Scope Discipline

Phase I is strictly limited to:

- In-memory data storage (no database, no files, no persistence)
- Single-user, local console execution
- No networking, no UI frameworks, no AI integration, no cloud services

Anything outside this scope MUST NOT be implemented.

**Rationale**: Maintains focus on core functionality, prevents premature complexity, establishes solid foundation for future phases.

### IV. Feature Completeness Over Optimization

All 5 Basic Todo features MUST be fully implemented before any enhancement:

1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

No premature optimization or extra features are allowed until these are complete.

**Rationale**: Ensures MVP delivery, prevents over-engineering, validates core functionality first.

### V. Deterministic and Predictable Behavior

Console output MUST be clear, consistent, and predictable.

User actions MUST always result in:

- Explicit confirmation messages
- Clear error handling (e.g., invalid ID, empty list)
- Consistent formatting and interaction patterns

**Rationale**: Provides reliable user experience, enables manual verification, simplifies debugging.

### VI. Clean Architecture Expectations

Code generated by Claude Code MUST follow:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Functions with single responsibility
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Readable and reviewable structure

**Rationale**: Even though code is AI-generated, it must be maintainable, understandable, and extensible by humans.

### VII. Explicit User Interaction Contracts

All user input expectations MUST be documented in the spec:

- Required inputs
- Valid formats
- Error conditions
- Expected responses

The console interface is treated as a formal API contract.

**Rationale**: Prevents ambiguity, enables validation, ensures consistent behavior, facilitates testing.

### VIII. Testability by Design

Although no formal test framework is required in Phase I:

- Logic MUST be deterministic
- Functions MUST be callable and verifiable independently
- Output MUST be easy to manually verify via console runs

**Rationale**: Ensures quality, enables validation, prepares for automated testing in future phases.

### IX. Spec Evolution Is Expected

Specs are living documents.

Refinement is encouraged until:

- Behavior matches requirements
- Claude Code produces correct output without manual edits
- All acceptance criteria are met

**Rationale**: Acknowledges iterative nature of specification development, allows for continuous improvement while maintaining spec-driven discipline.

## Phase I Scope

### In Scope

- Python console application
- In-memory task storage (list/dictionary structures)
- 5 core todo operations (add, view, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete)
- User input via console
- Clear console output and error messages
- Menu-driven interface

### Out of Scope

- File persistence
- Database integration
- Web interfaces or APIs
- Authentication/authorization
- Multi-user support
- Network communication
- AI integration
- Cloud deployment
- Advanced features (search, filter, tags, priorities beyond basic complete/incomplete)

## Definition of Done

Phase I is considered complete ONLY if ALL conditions are met:

- ✅ Constitution file exists and governs development
- ✅ Spec file exists for Phase I Todo features
- ✅ Claude Code generated all Python source files
- ✅ Application runs successfully from the console
- ✅ All 5 Basic Todo features work as specified
- ✅ No manual code edits were performed
- ✅ All acceptance criteria from spec are validated
- ✅ Error handling works for all documented error conditions

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority

The specification ALWAYS wins in case of conflict between:

- Human intent
- Claude Code output
- Existing code

**Resolution**: The spec MUST be updated and Claude Code MUST be rerun to regenerate implementation.

### Amendment Process

1. Identify conflict or needed change
2. Document proposed amendment and rationale
3. Update constitution with version increment
4. Regenerate affected artifacts
5. Validate consistency across all documents

### Compliance Verification

- All generated code MUST be traceable to spec requirements
- All specs MUST align with constitutional principles
- All implementations MUST pass Definition of Done criteria
- Violations MUST be resolved by spec refinement, not manual code fixes

### Version Control

Constitution follows semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible governance/principle changes
- **MINOR**: New principle/section additions or material expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

## Forward Compatibility Note

This Phase I Constitution establishes the foundation for:

- **Phase II**: Web Application
- **Phase III**: AI Chatbot Integration
- **Phase IV**: Cloud-Native Architecture
- **Phase V**: Kubernetes Deployment

All future phases MUST extend, not violate, these principles.

The core principles of Spec-Driven Development, No Manual Coding, and Clean Architecture will persist across all phases.

## Prompt

/sp.specify
Build a Phase I Todo application as a Python console program.

This is an in-memory, single-user Todo application intended as Phase I of the
"Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo" project.

The application must allow a user to manage a list of todo tasks using a
command-line interface.

Functional requirements:
- Users can add a task with a title and optional description
- Users can view all tasks with their ID, title, description, and completion status
- Users can update an existing task's title or description
- Users can delete a task by ID
- Users can mark a task as complete or incomplete

Behavior requirements:
- All tasks are stored in memory only (no database, no file persistence)
- Each task has a unique numeric ID generated by the system
- The application runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit
- The console interface presents a clear menu of options
- Invalid inputs (non-existent task IDs, invalid menu choices) are handled gracefully

Constraints:
- No authentication
- No external libraries
- No networking or UI frameworks
- Code must be generated exclusively by Claude Code
- All behavior must be traceable to this specification

Non-functional requirements:
- Clean, readable Python structure
- Functions should have single responsibility
- Output should be clear and user-friendly

This Phase I implementation serves as the foundation for later web, AI,
and cloud-native phases.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Phase I Todo application:

- Generated feature short-name: "console-todo-app"
- Created branch: 001-console-todo-app
- Feature number: 001

Specification includes:
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) covering all CRUD operations
- 14 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-014)
- 7 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-007)
- Edge case analysis
- Key entity definition (Task)

User Stories:
1. P1: View and Add Tasks - Core value proposition
2. P2: Mark Tasks Complete - Essential workflow
3. P3: Update Task Details - Usability enhancement
4. P4: Delete Unwanted Tasks - List management

All requirements are:
- Testable and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic (spec level)
- Traceable to user scenarios
- Free of implementation details

Validation checklist created and passed all quality checks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete, validated feature specification ready for architectural planning
- 🧪 Tests: Validation checklist with 14 quality criteria - all passed
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan (architectural design), /sp.clarify (if needed)
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec is complete with no clarifications needed. Clear scope boundaries established for Phase I foundation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification was complete from user input
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec Quality Checklist - PASSED (14/14 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan for architectural design

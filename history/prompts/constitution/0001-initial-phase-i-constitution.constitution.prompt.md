📜 Phase I Constitution
Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo

Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Application

Project Identity

This project is part of Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo, Phase I.
The goal of this phase is to build a Python-based in-memory Todo console application using strict Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus, without writing code manually.

Core Development Principles
1. Spec-Driven First (Non-Negotiable)

All development must start from written specifications, never from code.

No file may be implemented unless a corresponding spec exists and is approved.

Code is considered invalid if it is not traceable back to a written spec.

2. No Manual Coding

The human developer must not write Python code directly.

All implementation must be generated by Claude Code.

If output is incorrect, the spec must be refined, not the code.

3. Phase I Scope Discipline

Phase I is strictly limited to:

In-memory data storage (no database, no files, no persistence)

Single-user, local console execution

No networking, no UI frameworks, no AI, no cloud

Anything outside this scope must not be implemented.

4. Feature Completeness Over Optimization

All 5 Basic Todo features must be fully implemented before any enhancement:

Add Task

View Tasks

Update Task

Delete Task

Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

No premature optimization or extra features are allowed.

5. Deterministic and Predictable Behavior

Console output must be clear, consistent, and predictable.

User actions must always result in:

Explicit confirmation messages

Clear error handling (e.g., invalid ID, empty list)

6. Clean Architecture Expectations

Code generated by Claude Code must follow:

Clear separation of concerns

Functions with single responsibility

Meaningful variable and function names

Even though code is AI-generated, it must be readable and reviewable by humans.

7. Explicit User Interaction Contracts

All user input expectations must be documented in the spec:

Required inputs

Valid formats

Error conditions

The console interface is treated as a formal API.

8. Testability by Design

Although no formal test framework is required in Phase I:

Logic must be deterministic

Functions must be callable and verifiable independently

Output must be easy to manually verify via console runs.

9. Spec Evolution Is Expected

Specs are living documents.

Refinement is encouraged until:

Behavior matches requirements

Claude Code produces correct output without manual edits

Definition of Done (Phase I)

Phase I is considered complete only if all conditions are met:

✅ Constitution file exists and governs development

✅ Spec file exists for Phase I Todo features

✅ Claude Code generated all Python source files

✅ Application runs successfully from the console

✅ All 5 Basic Todo features work as specified

✅ No manual code edits were performed

Governance Rule

If there is a conflict between:

Human intent

Claude Code output

Existing code

👉 The specification always wins.
The spec must be updated and Claude Code rerun.

Forward Compatibility Note

This Phase I Constitution establishes the foundation for:

Phase II (Web App)

Phase III (AI Chatbot)

Phase IV & V (Cloud-Native Kubernetes)

All future phases must extend, not violate, these principles.

✅ This Constitution is fully aligned with:

Hackathon II requirements

Spec-Kit Plus methodology

Claude Code constraints

Phase I evaluation criteria
```

## Response snapshot

Created the Hackathon II Phase I Constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (Version 1.0.0).

**Key Components:**

1. **9 Core Principles** - All mapped from user input:
   - I. Spec-Driven First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - II. No Manual Coding
   - III. Phase I Scope Discipline
   - IV. Feature Completeness Over Optimization
   - V. Deterministic and Predictable Behavior
   - VI. Clean Architecture Expectations
   - VII. Explicit User Interaction Contracts
   - VIII. Testability by Design
   - IX. Spec Evolution Is Expected

2. **Phase I Scope** - Explicit in-scope and out-of-scope items

3. **Definition of Done** - 8 specific completion criteria

4. **Governance** - Constitutional authority, amendment process, compliance verification, versioning policy

5. **Forward Compatibility** - Multi-phase roadmap alignment

**Template Consistency:**
- ✅ plan-template.md - Reviewed, aligned with constitution principles
- ✅ spec-template.md - Reviewed, aligned with user scenario requirements
- ✅ tasks-template.md - Reviewed, aligned with testability requirements
- ⚠ Command files in .claude/commands/ - Pending review for constitution references

**Version:** 1.0.0 (Initial constitution)
**Ratified:** 2025-12-19

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance for Hackathon II Phase I project; all development must now follow 9 core principles with spec-driven, AI-generated implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Constitution is governance document)
- 📁 Files: 1 created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.specify` to create Phase I Todo feature specification, `/sp.plan` for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures Phase I constraints (in-memory, console-only, no manual coding) while establishing principles that will scale to Phases II-V

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution successfully created with all placeholders filled, proper versioning (1.0.0), and comprehensive governance rules
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (First constitution creation - no prior baseline)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (Direct constitution creation from user specification)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A (Constitution accepted as v1.0.0; future amendments will follow semantic versioning with MINOR bumps for new principles)
